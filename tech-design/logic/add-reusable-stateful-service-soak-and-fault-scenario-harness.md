summary: Add a reusable bounded stateful-service lifecycle with retained evidence and Lumen/Tape domain adapters.
capability_refs:
  - id: stateful-service-scenarios
    role: primary
    claim: reusable-bounded-stateful-lifecycle-and-consumer-adapters
    coverage: full
    rationale: "The TD defines and verifies the complete shared runner plus its first two stateful-service consumer adapters."
